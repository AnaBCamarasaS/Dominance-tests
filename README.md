# Dominance-tests

This application has been done in order to have more examples in the Degree Final Dissertation. This application has been done by Ana Belén Camarasa (e-mail: abcs3@alu.ua.es), who is a Mathematics student at Alicante University, under the supervision of her mentor Julio Mulero (e-mail:julio.mulero@ua.es). 
 
 In this application we have two tests, one to test the first stochastic dominance and the other one to test the second stochastic dominance. You can enter your data as a parametric distribution or as XLSX file. It's necessary to bear in mind that "número de réplicas de Monte Carlo" is the number of times that you do the Monte Carlo simulation for obtain the p-value. So, using a big number of Monte Carlo means that you ensure to make less error when you make your final decission of second stochastic dominance. However, when this amount is big it takes more time to show you the answer.
